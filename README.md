## CS 336 - Web Development

This is sample code for
[CS 336 at Calvin College](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/336/kvlinden).
It includes:

- Code examples illustrating fundamental concepts in Web development,
all based on Node/Express (units 1-7).

- A ReactJS application based on Facebook's (old) React
[Tutorial](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/336/kvlinden/08react/backup/Tutorial_React.html)
and then refactored and enhanced as described in the lab exercises
(units 8-14).

For details, see the
[course schedule](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/336/kvlinden/schedule.html).

### Getting Started

To use this code, do the following:
1. Create your own CS 336 code repo on GitHub:
`https://github.com/GITHUB_ID/cs336`
2. Clone this quick-start repo to your local machine.
3. Add a second git remote to this new local copy pointing to your new
GitHub repo and then commit/push this code to that repo.
For details on this process, see
[Git Basics - Working with Remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes).

You will generally work with this initial copy in your own repo.
If we make changes to this quick-start code, we will let you know what's
changed so that you can pull/merge those changes (from the original remote)
into your own code.
