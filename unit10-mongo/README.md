This sample code supports Calvin College
[CS 336](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/336/kvlinden)
[Unit 10: MongoDB](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/336/kvlinden/10mongo/index.html).

The lab will upgrade the application from lab 9 to load data from
mLab rather than a static text file. Be sure to set the mLab MongoDB
password by setting the appropriate environment variable:

```
% export MONGO_PASSWORD=<the_class_password>
```
